### Day 2 January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Woke up at 5am to get some code time in before work. I started the day by building my own version of the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

**Thoughts:** The project is supposed to be done using bootstrap, but I feel I can do this must easier with less css and server requests by just using plan css and flexbox .

### Day 3 January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) page is finished for the most part.

**Thoughts:** I changed the project away from bootstrap to flexbox. everything was great until I tried to intergrate mailchimp. I have a few issues to deal with, but since it is getting late they will have to wait til the morning.

### Day 4 February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished working on the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

**Thoughts:** I made the mistake of building out the entire page without looking at the mailchimp documentation. So the button I intended to use for linking to mailchimps sign up for did not work because they used an input instead. With a little modification and a lesson learned all is good.

### Day 21 February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I noticed some major issues with the site when it comes to responsiveness. I realize I need to:

1. Plan before starting project.
2. Sketch out a design to better understand the markup needed and avoid the need to add markup later.
3. A better understanding of css-grid and flexbox, so I can avoid adding unnecessary containers to the markup.

I created a new branch for the project so I can rebuild the right way.

**Thoughts:** I will most likely spend several days build demos using flexbox, grid, and a combination of both.
