### Day 2 January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Woke up at 5am to get some code time in before work. I started the day by building my own version of the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

**Thoughts:** The project is supposed to be done using bootstrap, but I feel I can do this must easier with less css and server requests by just using plan css and flexbox .

### Day 3 January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) page is finished for the most part.

**Thoughts:** I changed the project away from bootstrap to flexbox. everything was great until I tried to intergrate mailchimp. I have a few issues to deal with, but since it is getting late they will have to wait til the morning.

### Day 4 February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished working on the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

**Thoughts:** I made the mistake of building out the entire page without looking at the mailchimp documentation. So the button I intended to use for linking to mailchimps sign up for did not work because they used an input instead. With a little modification and a lesson learned all is good.

### Day 9 February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: The project is mostly complete, there are still a few things I am not quite happy with yet.

**Thoughts:** I still need to add a few media queries. Since I used grid and flexbox the media quieries should not be very big. I also need to refactor the CSS before I can submit the project.

### Day 10 February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: One bug holding up project completion will figure it out tomorrow and submit project.

**Thoughts:** Looked over entire project thought everything was ready to go, decided to fire browsersync to make sure and found in issue. The video overlay is overflowing, leaving a grey box on mobile only. I got ride of box but overlay color is not getting dark enough. Back to the drawing board.
