### Day 1 January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Woke up at 5am to get some code time in before work. I started the day by building my own version of the startup landing page project from [course Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

**Thoughts:** The project is supposed to be done using bootstrap, but I feel I can do this must easier with less css and server requests by just using plan css and flexbox .
